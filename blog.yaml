    play a little dress up
    put on an ego for you to see
    i'll dream about what could have been
    repeat what should have been said then

    i can't seem to forgive myself
    i'm a terrible person
    nothing is enough for me
    it's halloween
    no different
    but i guess it's okay to be scared today

    i recognize myself in the darkness
    the only embrace that's natural to me
    a hug i can't roll my eyes at
    the lover i look in the face
    the only that will never leave
    my baby gives me chills
    she fucks me every night
    and when i plug my ears
    i let her surround me
    a floating set of eyes
    that can only look down at the street
    she puts me in the fish bowl
    stir me up and watch the bubbles
    she's here while you're gone
    she's been here all along

    i'm a loaded revolver
    and it's just me here
    no one to pull my trigger
    put me in your mouth
    pour the pain out

  content: |
    when everything is so haunted
    purple hair and pierced ears
    hurt close but not near
    messages with no emoji
    a touch with no energy

    i feel it but it's not real
    i don't think i'm here
    empty but i'm whole
    you're a part of the show
    can i prove it didn't matter
    is it like it never happened

    the air feels course on my skin
    monkey still on my fucking back
    find a needle to tuck me in
    not far but a long way back

    need something to make it slow
    time you met who you are
    she'll feel the scars you never show
    kept hiden closer than far

    it's all blue blue blue
    cold like a brick in the shade
    let everyone step on you
    warmth that will never stay

    the silence only lasts a day
    squeeze your hand 'til it turns white
    kill the metaphor you let carry you away
    like bloody knuckles without a fight

    when the sky is blood orange
    you'll find it just like it was
    like you were never even around
    you made such a pointless fuss

    all the ringing in your ears
    cuts the silence you don't feel
    so what i want you here
    chump tricked out of a deal

    all i know is how i feel
    my head is an encyclopedia
    filled with repeated phrases and redacted lines
    your name starts with a big curly letter

    i've got lights in my eyes
    a flame in my heart
    from the torch passed hand to hand
    fire in someone else's mind

    you still think about that church like you knew you would

    stain glass red like blood, evil thoughts still in your head

    happen upon a simple machine that turns pain into steam
  
    have you seen such a thing, eyes gold like a ring

    i'd kill if i knew how, in a dream it felt so easy

    take a number in the line, its long since been your time

    as i run my fingers through her hair
    my heart can tell the difference my finger tips cannot
    smell and sight betray you
    if i hold my breath i replaced you
    she only became you for my finger tips

    youll never see the sun burn i got in LA
    or the tattoos i gave myself
    when the pain felt closer to you
    its okay i guess
    maybe they will be cool one day
    when you see me in the grocery store
    and ive finally stopped looking for you
