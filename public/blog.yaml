    i've got lights in my eyes
    a flame in my heart
    from the torch passed hand to hand
    fire in someone else's mind

    all of this life's secrets
    everything i'm missing

    you still think about that church like you knew you would

    stain glass red like blood, evil thoughts still in your head

    happen upon a simple machine that turns pain into steam
  
    have you seen such a thing, eyes gold like a ring

    i'd kill if i knew how, in a dream it felt so easy

    take a number in the line, its long since been your time

    suddenly i'm 17 again
    the darkness i let in
    still driving around
    seeking what can't be found

    as i run my fingers through her hair
    my heart can tell the difference my finger tips cannot
    smell and sight betray you
    if i hold my breath i replaced you
    she only became you for my finger tips

    youll never see the sun burn i got in LA
    or the tattoos i gave myself
    when the pain felt closer to you
    its okay i guess
    maybe they will be cool one day
    when you see me in the grocery store
    and ive finally stopped looking for you

    i wanna sleep in your bed
    wake up at 3 kiss your head
    missed bridge at noon that’s too bad
    I’m old and free just living fast

    I lost my teeth heart attack
    but you're with me not so bad
    just sold the home kids are gone
    no work to do yeah were done
