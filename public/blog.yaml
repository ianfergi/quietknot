    youll never see the sun burn i got in LA
    or the tattoos i gave myself
    when the pain felt closer to you
    its okay i guess
    maybe they will be cool one day
    when you see me in the grocery store
    and ive finally stopped looking for you

    i wanna sleep in your bed
    wake up at 3 kiss your head
    missed bridge at noon that’s too bad
    I’m old and free just living fast

    I lost my teeth heart attack
    but you're with me not so bad
    just sold the home kids are gone
    no work to do yeah were done
